  text: `**How to play**
Try to count to ten as a pair or group without speaking at the same time and without deciding who goes next. // One person starts by saying “one.” // Anyone can say the next number in order, but if two people speak at once, you must start over at “one!”
**Example**
One person says “one.” // Another says “two.” // Someone else says “three.” // If two people say “four” at the same time, you reset and begin again at “one.”
**Optional challenge**
- Once you succeed, try counting to twenty for a bigger challenge! //
- try looking at the floor so you’re not tempted to signal to each other to speak!`

Start by counting to five together. // Then take turns creating a new silly rule to replace one number.

**Example**
One player says, “Instead of saying ‘four,’ we’re going to clap.” // You then count together: 1, 2, 3, clap, 5. // Next, another player adds a rule, such as, “Instead of saying ‘two,’ we shout ‘Yippee!’” // Now you count: 1, Yippee!, 3, clap, 5.

Continue adding rules for numbers (including ones already changed) until you can count to five using only the rules.

This is a more challenging twist on word association where players secretly skip a step. // The first person says a random word. // The next person thinks of a word related to it but does not say it out loud. // Instead, they say a word associated with that secret middle word. // Each player continues using the same “secret middle” rule.

**Example**

One player freezes in a dramatic facial expression. // The other player looks at the face and says out loud what they think the inner thoughts of that face might be.

Player one makes an over-the-top grossed-out face with their tongue sticking out and eyes squinting. // Player two says, “Ewww, I can’t believe I just drank milk that expired in 1972!” // Then switch roles and repeat.

**Optional challenge**
Encourage bigger, more exaggerated faces or longer inner monologues to increase the silliness. // This could include incorporating movement into the facial expressions, like doing three different facial expressions back-to-back to give the other player a bit of a story to tell.

Example: a frown, then a scared face, then a sleepy face might prompt the other player to say, “Aw man, I dropped my sandwich… Aaa! There’s a tarantula crawling on it! Oh, that was just a hairball and now I’m sleepy from all that excitement and no snack.”`,

Count down together from three. // On “one,” try to say the same word at the same time. // This works best when one person (often the child) acts as the leader and the other player carefully observes and tunes in, with the leader speaking slowly and clearly.

**How to play — Option 2: Category Mind Meld**
Choose a category such as food, animals, or sports. // Count down and try to say the same word from that category at the same time. // See how many tries it takes to match.

**How to play — Option 3: Convergence**
This version works best with slightly older kids. // Count down from three and say two random words at the same time. // Without speaking, both players think of a word that could connect those two words. // On the next count of three, say that connecting word. // Continue repeating this process until you end up saying the same word at the same time.

* Excited face, bored and monotone voice
* Sad face, joyful singing voice
* Proud face, embarrassed whisper
* Frustrated face, relaxed sigh
* Sleepy face, hyper and energetic voice
* Nervous face, cool and confident voice

Silly or specific scenarios

One player is the Voice, and one player is the Face. // The Voice talks out loud, while the Face silently lip-syncs in real time, matching mouth movements and facial expressions as closely as possible so it looks like the voice belongs to them.

Switch roles after each round.

**Example**
The Voice says, “Let me tell you about my favorite thing to do on a rainy day…” while the Face mouths the words and exaggerates expressions to match the tone.

**Optional variations**
* Set up a camera so the Voice is off-screen. When you watch it back, it looks like the person lip syncing is actually talking.
* Use prompts such as:
    * “Here’s my most embarrassing story…”
    * “This is the craziest thing that ever happened to me…”

* Real-time: One player makes the face while the other makes the sound at the same time.
* Two-step: The face is shown once silently. Then it is repeated while the other player adds the sound. This version allows for more accuracy, but either way is fun!

**Example**
One player makes a slow, creaky door sound. // The other responds with a strained, squeaky facial expression.

* A device with emojis available, or
* Emoji chart

Simple facial expression emojis work best, but more obscure emojis can be used for an extra challenge!

**How to play — Simple version**
Take turns secretly choosing an emoji. // Act it out using only your face while the other player guesses which emoji you’re portraying.

**Example**
One player secretly chooses 😲 and acts out wide eyes and an open mouth. // The other player guesses 😲.

**How to play — Two-device challenge**
One player secretly chooses three emojis and acts them out one at a time. // The other player writes down or remembers the emojis they think are being performed. // Compare lists at the end to see how many matched.

**Example**
Player one acts out 😡 → 🤔 → 😂 // Player two guesses 😡 → 😐 → 😂 // Then you compare which ones matched.

**How to play — Printable chart version**
Using the emoji chart, one player secretly picks an emoji in their head and acts it out. // The other player points to the emoji on the chart they think is being replicated. // Then switch roles.

**Example**
One player acts out 😜. // The other player points to 😜 on the chart.

**Optional challenge**
* Use less obvious emojis like 🤯, 🥴, or 😬
* Limit yourself to only facial movement with no sound
* Make the sound you think that emoji would be making
* Exaggerate expressions as much as possible`,

  text: `**How to play: Magic Towel version**
Hold a towel, blanket, or piece of fabric in front of your face. // While your face is covered, quickly change your facial expression. // Lower the towel to reveal the new face as if it appeared by magic.

**Example**
You hide your face behind the towel, then lower it to reveal an over-the-top shocked face or a silly grin. // Then, raise the towel back up and when it’s in front of your face again, you change it to a sad face, then lower it.

**Optional challenge**
Speed it up so the expression appears to change instantly behind the towel, like a magic trick.

**How to play: Face Filters version**
Instead of a towel, swipe your hand in front of your face (or have someone else swipe their hand). // Each swipe “changes the filter,” meaning you instantly switch to a new facial expression.

**Example**
A hand swipes across your face and you suddenly switch from a sleepy face to an excited one.

**Optional variations**
* Add imaginary “filters” such as birds flying over your head, fire breathing, sparkles, or slow-motion effects
* Include sound effects or body movement to match each new face
* Take turns being the one who swipes and the one who changes faces`,

  title: "Yes, And",
  text: `**How to play**
One person starts by saying a statement. // The other person must respond beginning with the words “Yes, and…”, agreeing with what was just said and adding a new detail that fits. // Players take turns continuing the exchange, always accepting the last idea and building on it.

The only rule is that responses must start with “Yes, and...”

**Example**
Player one: “I’m so excited it’s your birthday today!” // Player two: “Yes, and it’s almost time to eat cake...” // Player one: “Yes, and it’s our favorite kind, chocolate with sprinkles.!” // Player two: “Yes, and I can’t believe the sprinkles were on sale for half off at the grocery store!”

**How it works**
Each new sentence grows directly out of what the last person said. // No correcting, redirecting, or taking over the story. // Just listening, accepting, and adding! // This “yes, and” principle is the basis of improv, so this is a perfect game to introduce the concept.

**Optional prompts to get started**
* “We’re going on an adventure…”
* “This is the best day ever because…”
* “Something surprising just happened…”
* “I just opened the door and saw…”

**Optional challenge**
* Set a timer and try to keep the story going for a full minute without pausing - it’s a great exercise in not overthinking!
* Switch to whispering, dramatic voices, or silly accents

One person makes a statement. // The next person must respond starting with “Yes, but…”, agreeing with what was said and then adding a surprising or silly detail that changes the direction slightly. // Players take turns continuing the conversation, always accepting what came before while introducing a new twist.

The key is that the “but” adds interest, not resistance!

**Example**
Player one: “I heard there’s a new ice cream shop down the street.” // Player two: “Yes, but they only serve pickle-flavored ice cream…” // Player one: “Yes, but it’s apparently really delicious!” // Player two: “Yes, but they serve it with chopsticks instead of spoons.” // Player one: “Yes, but the chopsticks help you pick out the pickle chunks.”

**How it works**
Each response still agrees with the reality of the story. // The fun comes from how strange or unexpected the twists become, not from shutting ideas down.

**Optional prompts to get started**
* “We just found a secret door…”
* “Something unusual showed up at dinner…”
* “Our family won a prize…”

* Present a problem or challenge
* Add an adventure
* Work toward a solution

“Tell me about the time you accidentally took a bath in green food coloring.” // The other player launches into the story as if it really happened: “Oh, I had almost forgotten about that! I thought it was essential oils so I squirted the whole bottle in the tub thinking it would smell good!”

**Prompts to get you started**
* Tell me about the time a cow wandered into your backyard and you had to find its owner
* Tell me about the time you were about to bite into an orange and it started screaming
* Tell me about the time you drank so much lemonade you bounced onto the roof
* Tell me about the time your shoes ran away without you`,

  text: `**How to play**
Pick a random book. // Chapter books or kid-friendly novels work best. // One player starts a conversation by speaking normally. // The other player may only respond by flipping through the book and reading a line out loud that could somewhat make sense as a reply.

**Example**
Player one: “How was your day today?” // Player two flips through the book and reads: “It was the strangest afternoon he could remember.” // Player one: “Oh… I’m sorry to hear that! What happened?”

**Ways to play**
* Adult challenge: The adult must respond only with lines from the book while the child can say anything.
* Reading partners: If both players can read, each person uses their own book and the entire conversation happens through book lines only!

**Optional challenge**
* Set a time limit for finding a line
* Switch books halfway through`,

  title: "One-Word Song",
  text: `**How to play**
Make up a song by switching off every word. // One person says or sings a word, then the next person adds the next word, continuing back and forth.

You can clap or snap to keep a beat, try to rhyme, or ignore rhyming altogether.

**Example**
“I” // “love” // “beans” // “so” // “much” // “don’t” // “you?”

**Ways to make it easier**
* Switch off every line instead of every word
* Choose a silly song title ahead of time to give yourselves some direction
    * “I Love Beans”
    * “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout That Pimple”
    * “Goody Goody Gumdrops”

**Warm-up option**
If making up a song feels like too much pressure, start by rewriting a song you both know well into a simple parody! // This gives you a structure to build from and is a fun creative challenge.

**Optional challenge**
* Add a steady rhythm or tempo
* Try different music styles (opera, pop, country)`,

  title: "Build-a-Rap",
  text: `**How to play**
First: Establish the rhythm // Everyone starts and continues with the same steady beat: // “Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba”

This rhythm happens:
* At the very beginning
* In between every rhyming line
* Anytime the group needs to reset or regroup

Next: // One person starts by setting the rhyme. // They say: // “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with ___,” // and choose a simple one-syllable word that is easy to rhyme with.

Everyone immediately does the rhythm together: // Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba

Then the next person adds a rhyming line. // After each line, everyone returns to the rhythm before the next person goes.

Players take turns adding new rhymes that match the same sound.

**Example flow**
Player one: “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with bee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player two: “Oops, I fell and scraped my knee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player three: “And then I really had to pee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player four: “But look, I found my missing key.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba

**Reminder**
The goal is simply to keep the rhyme going. // The story does not have to make sense. // Each line just needs to rhyme and fit the rhythm!

**If someone gets stuck**
If it’s your turn and you can’t think of a rhyme, you can always reset the game by saying: // “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with ___,” // and choosing a new rhyme.

Everyone then switches to rhyming with that new word and keeps going.

**Optional advanced version**
At a higher level, the group can try to shout the final rhyming word together, guessing what the speaker is about to say based on context and the rhyme sound. // This is what gives it that “Beastie Boys” feel.

This is fun but completely optional. // The game is just as fun without that aspect!

**Helpful tips**
* Keep the beat steady and forgiving
* Silly is perfect; it doesn’t need to make sense or even be a real word
* Resetting is part of the game, not a failure`,

  title: "Syllable Swap",
  text: `**How to play**
Choose a song everyone knows well. // Sing the song together, but trade off every syllable, one at a time, rotating through the players.

Each person only sings their assigned syllable, then immediately passes it to the next player.

**Example**
If you’re playing with three people and choose We Are Family, it might sound like:
* Player one: “we”
* Player two: “are”
* Player three: “fam”
* Player one: “i”
* Player two: “ly”

Then continue through the song the same way.

**Ways to make it easier**
* Start by swapping every word instead of every syllable
* Use a slower song
* Practice one line at a time; don’t try to do the whole song at once

**Optional challenge**
Try moving your mouth the entire time, even when it’s not your syllable. // This is very tricky and almost always ends in laughter!`,

  title: "Song-on-the-Spot",
  text: `**How to play**
Two players sing a song together simultaneously, inventing the lyrics as they go. // One person leads while the other carefully follows, trying to match the words, melody, and timing in real time.

Switch who leads after a verse or whenever it feels right.

**How it works**
The leader sets the pace and direction. // The follower listens closely and does their best to stay perfectly in sync, even when the song goes in unexpected directions.

The goal is not to sound good, but to stay together.

**Helpful way to start**
Come up with a made-up song title before you begin. // This gives the song a shared direction right away.

**Example starters**
* “Our New Favorite Donut Shop”
* “The Day Everything Went Wrong”
* “Why Is This Happening to Us?”

**Ways to play with more people**
* One person can act as an interviewer, introducing the duo and asking questions about their “new album”
* The duo responds by breaking into another song together on the spot

**Optional additions**
* Add clapping, snapping, or body percussion
* Use big gestures or dramatic expressions
* Change styles halfway through`,

  text: `**How to play**
Choose a familiar song. // One person “sings” the song using only chicken bawking sounds, following the melody and rhythm as closely as possible. // The other players listen and try to guess which song it is.

Then switch roles and try again.

**Fun variations**
* “Baa” that tune
* “Moo” that tune
* “Croak” that tune
* “Yawn” that tune
* “Burp” that tune
* Or invent your own sound, like “Blub that tune!”`,

  title: "The Jingle Game",
  text: `**How to play**
Pick a random item nearby. // One person holds it up and sings a short opening line naming the “product.” // The next person immediately finishes the jingle with any line that comes to mind.

Then switch roles or choose a new item and start again. // There is no right melody, no required rhyme, and no correct answer. // The only goal is to respond quickly without overthinking!

**Example**
Player one holds up a bar of soap and sings, “Bar of soap!” // Player two responds, “The cleanest armpits you’ll ever smell!”

**Helpful tip before playing**
It can help to briefly remind kids what jingles are before you start. // Listening to or recalling familiar ones gives everyone a sense of the vibe.

Examples include:
* “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”
* “Ba da ba ba ba, I’m lovin’ it” (McDonald's)
* “We are farmers… bum buh dum dum bum dum dum” (Farmers Insurance)

There is no required structure, but it often helps to think of a jingle as:
* Singing the product name
* Saying what it does
* Or why it’s great

That framework can make it easier to jump in.

**Ways to play anywhere**
* At home with random household items
* In the car by making jingles for billboards or businesses you pass
* At the store by quietly inventing jingles as you shop together - hand each other random items and challenge each other to come up with a jingle on the spot!`,

  text: `**How to play**
One player claps out a steady beat and calls out, “5, 6, 7, 8!” // The other player immediately begins an improvised dance while the first player counts the beats out loud.

Dance for two full 8-counts, then finish with a strong pose.

Switch roles and repeat.

**Ways to adjust**
* Do one 8-count instead of two… or more!
* Dance very slowly or very fast
* Add themed dances like robot, ballerina, dinosaur, or sleepy sloth

**Optional challenge**
* Add some upbeat music instead of clapping
* Freeze dramatically between 8-counts
* Have the counter call out style changes mid-dance
* Surprise each other at random moments throughout the day by saying, [other person’s name!] 5, 6, 7, 8 and challenging them to drop everything and do a quick dance!`,

  text: `**How to play**
One person pretends they’ve discovered a cool new dance trend. // They give the dance a name and then teach it step by step, explaining the moves out loud.

Once everyone knows the steps, play music or sing a song together and do the dance as a group.

Then switch leaders and invent a new trend.

**Example**
Leader: “Have you heard of this new dance trend? It’s called I Ate Too Many Donuts.” // They then teach the moves:
* Put one hand on your belly
* Put the other hand on your belly
* Bend over and say “ouch”
* Sit down and roll on the floor

Everyone performs the dance together.

* Let someone else add a new move halfway through
* Speed the dance up or slow it way down
* Change the music style mid-dance
* Perform the dance like it’s going viral online`,
