  text: `**How to play**
Try to count to ten as a pair or group without speaking at the same time and without deciding who goes next. // One person starts by saying “one.” // Anyone can say the next number in order, but if two people speak at once, you must start over at “one!”
**Example**
One person says “one.” // Another says “two.” // Someone else says “three.” // If two people say “four” at the same time, you reset and begin again at “one.”
**Optional challenge**
- Once you succeed, try counting to twenty for a bigger challenge! //
- try looking at the floor so you’re not tempted to signal to each other to speak!`

Start by counting to five together. // Then take turns creating a new silly rule to replace one number.

**Example**
One player says, “Instead of saying ‘four,’ we’re going to clap.” // You then count together: 1, 2, 3, clap, 5. // Next, another player adds a rule, such as, “Instead of saying ‘two,’ we shout ‘Yippee!’” // Now you count: 1, Yippee!, 3, clap, 5.

Continue adding rules for numbers (including ones already changed) until you can count to five using only the rules.

Speed it up once you get the hang of it, or increase the number beyond five!`,

This is a more challenging twist on word association where players secretly skip a step. // The first person says a random word. // The next person thinks of a word related to it but does not say it out loud. // Instead, they say a word associated with that secret middle word. // Each player continues using the same “secret middle” rule.

**Example**
Player one says “banana.” // Player two thinks “yellow” but says “sun.” // The next player might think “hot” and say “cheese.”

One player freezes in a dramatic facial expression. // The other player looks at the face and says out loud what they think the inner thoughts of that face might be.

**Example**
Player one makes an over-the-top grossed-out face with their tongue sticking out and eyes squinting. // Player two says, “Ewww, I can’t believe I just drank milk that expired in 1972!” // Then switch roles and repeat.

**Optional challenge**
Encourage bigger, more exaggerated faces or longer inner monologues to increase the silliness. // This could include incorporating movement into the facial expressions, like doing three different facial expressions back-to-back to give the other player a bit of a story to tell.

Example: a frown, then a scared face, then a sleepy face might prompt the other player to say, “Aw man, I dropped my sandwich… Aaa! There’s a tarantula crawling on it! Oh, that was just a hairball and now I’m sleepy from all that excitement and no snack.”`,

Count down together from three. // On “one,” try to say the same word at the same time. // This works best when one person (often the child) acts as the leader and the other player carefully observes and tunes in, with the leader speaking slowly and clearly.

**How to play — Option 2: Category Mind Meld**
Choose a category such as food, animals, or sports. // Count down and try to say the same word from that category at the same time. // See how many tries it takes to match.

**How to play — Option 3: Convergence**
This version works best with slightly older kids. // Count down from three and say two random words at the same time. // Without speaking, both players think of a word that could connect those two words. // On the next count of three, say that connecting word. // Continue repeating this process until you end up saying the same word at the same time.

If you start feeling stuck, reset and begin again with a brand-new word. // In improv, this is sometimes called “going out to go in,” meaning you zoom out of the game so you can re-enter with fresh energy. // The goal is to have fun, not to force it!`,

**Example**
“Make the face of someone who is really happy, but the sound of someone who is really sad.”

**How it looks**
A giant beaming smile paired with dramatic sobbing, or a frown paired with cheerful giggles.

**More examples to get you started**

Opposing emotions
* Angry face, calm and peaceful voice
* Scared face, brave superhero voice
* Excited face, bored and monotone voice
* Sad face, joyful singing voice
* Proud face, embarrassed whisper
* Frustrated face, relaxed sigh
* Sleepy face, hyper and energetic voice
* Nervous face, cool and confident voice

Silly or specific scenarios
* Face of someone who just stepped in dog poop, sound of someone who won the lottery

One player is the Voice, and one player is the Face. // The Voice talks out loud, while the Face silently lip-syncs in real time, matching mouth movements and facial expressions as closely as possible so it looks like the voice belongs to them.

Switch roles after each round.

**Example**
The Voice says, “Let me tell you about my favorite thing to do on a rainy day…” while the Face mouths the words and exaggerates expressions to match the tone.

**Optional variations**
* Set up a camera so the Voice is off-screen. When you watch it back, it looks like the person lip syncing is actually talking.
* Use prompts such as:
    * “Here’s my most embarrassing story…”
    * “This is the craziest thing that ever happened to me…”
    * “Let me explain how I became a superhero.”

One player makes a silent facial expression while the other player creates the sound they think matches that face.

* Real-time: One player makes the face while the other makes the sound at the same time.
* Two-step: The face is shown once silently. Then it is repeated while the other player adds the sound. This version allows for more accuracy, but either way is fun!

**Ways to play**
* Real-time: The sound and face happen at the same time.
* Two-step: The sound is made once with minimal facial expression, then repeated while the other player performs a dramatic matching face.

**Example**
One player makes a slow, creaky door sound. // The other responds with a strained, squeaky facial expression.

**Optional challenge**
Limit the sound-maker’s facial movement to increase the difficulty, or layer multiple sounds in a row!`,

  title: "Guess the Emoji",
  text: `**What you need**
* A device with emojis available, or
* Emoji chart

Simple facial expression emojis work best, but more obscure emojis can be used for an extra challenge!

**How to play — Simple version**
Take turns secretly choosing an emoji. // Act it out using only your face while the other player guesses which emoji you’re portraying.

**Example**
One player secretly chooses 😲 and acts out wide eyes and an open mouth. // The other player guesses 😲.

**How to play — Two-device challenge**
One player secretly chooses three emojis and acts them out one at a time. // The other player writes down or remembers the emojis they think are being performed. // Compare lists at the end to see how many matched.

**Example**
Player one acts out 😡 → 🤔 → 😂 // Player two guesses 😡 → 😐 → 😂 // Then you compare which ones matched.

**How to play — Printable chart version**
Using the emoji chart, one player secretly picks an emoji in their head and acts it out. // The other player points to the emoji on the chart they think is being replicated. // Then switch roles.

**Example**
One player acts out 😜. // The other player points to 😜 on the chart.

**Optional challenge**
* Use less obvious emojis like 🤯, 🥴, or 😬
* Limit yourself to only facial movement with no sound
* Make the sound you think that emoji would be making
* Exaggerate expressions as much as possible`,

**Ways to adjust the challenge**
* Easier: Use well-known songs, rhymes, or short phrases.
    * “Row, row, row your boat”
    * “Happy birthday”
* Harder: Use longer or sillier sentences.
    * “Have you ever tried eating ketchup on your ice cream?”

  text: `**How to play: Magic Towel version**
Hold a towel, blanket, or piece of fabric in front of your face. // While your face is covered, quickly change your facial expression. // Lower the towel to reveal the new face as if it appeared by magic.

**Example**
You hide your face behind the towel, then lower it to reveal an over-the-top shocked face or a silly grin. // Then, raise the towel back up and when it’s in front of your face again, you change it to a sad face, then lower it.

**Optional challenge**
Speed it up so the expression appears to change instantly behind the towel, like a magic trick.

**How to play: Face Filters version**
Instead of a towel, swipe your hand in front of your face (or have someone else swipe their hand). // Each swipe “changes the filter,” meaning you instantly switch to a new facial expression.

**Example**
A hand swipes across your face and you suddenly switch from a sleepy face to an excited one.

**Optional variations**
* Add imaginary “filters” such as birds flying over your head, fire breathing, sparkles, or slow-motion effects
* Include sound effects or body movement to match each new face
* Take turns being the one who swipes and the one who changes faces`,

  title: "Yes, And",
  text: `**How to play**
One person starts by saying a statement. // The other person must respond beginning with the words “Yes, and…”, agreeing with what was just said and adding a new detail that fits. // Players take turns continuing the exchange, always accepting the last idea and building on it.

The only rule is that responses must start with “Yes, and...”

**Example**
Player one: “I’m so excited it’s your birthday today!” // Player two: “Yes, and it’s almost time to eat cake...” // Player one: “Yes, and it’s our favorite kind, chocolate with sprinkles.!” // Player two: “Yes, and I can’t believe the sprinkles were on sale for half off at the grocery store!”

**How it works**
Each new sentence grows directly out of what the last person said. // No correcting, redirecting, or taking over the story. // Just listening, accepting, and adding! // This “yes, and” principle is the basis of improv, so this is a perfect game to introduce the concept.

**Optional prompts to get started**
* “We’re going on an adventure…”
* “This is the best day ever because…”
* “Something surprising just happened…”
* “I just opened the door and saw…”

**Optional challenge**
* Set a timer and try to keep the story going for a full minute without pausing - it’s a great exercise in not overthinking!
* Switch to whispering, dramatic voices, or silly accents

**Why this game matters**
This game helps kids practice listening, flexibility, and cooperation in real time. // It encourages letting go of control, trusting the group, and discovering that building together is more fun than steering alone.`,

One person makes a statement. // The next person must respond starting with “Yes, but…”, agreeing with what was said and then adding a surprising or silly detail that changes the direction slightly. // Players take turns continuing the conversation, always accepting what came before while introducing a new twist.

The key is that the “but” adds interest, not resistance!

**Example**
Player one: “I heard there’s a new ice cream shop down the street.” // Player two: “Yes, but they only serve pickle-flavored ice cream…” // Player one: “Yes, but it’s apparently really delicious!” // Player two: “Yes, but they serve it with chopsticks instead of spoons.” // Player one: “Yes, but the chopsticks help you pick out the pickle chunks.”

**How it works**
Each response still agrees with the reality of the story. // The fun comes from how strange or unexpected the twists become, not from shutting ideas down.

**Optional prompts to get started**
* “We just found a secret door…”
* “Something unusual showed up at dinner…”
* “Our family won a prize…”

The goal is not sincerity or realism, but playful escalation.

**Example**
Player one: “I just love your shoes!” // Player two: “Thank you, but I love the way your shoes squeak when you walk. It reminds me of a cute mouse.” // Player one: “Thank you, but speaking of mice, I love the way you eat cheese so carefully!” // Player two: “Thank you, but the way I eat cheese is nothing compared to your cheesy jokes.

* Present a problem or challenge
* Add an adventure
* Work toward a solution

  text: `**How to play**
Tell a story together, one sentence at a time. // Players alternate sentences, starting each one with either “Fortunately…” or “Unfortunately…” and continuing the story from there. // Each sentence responds directly to the last one. // The story keeps swinging between problems and silver linings.

**Example**
“Unfortunately, I lost my shoes.” // “Fortunately, I love being barefoot.” // “Unfortunately, I stepped on a Lego.” // “Fortunately, it was the Lego I’d been missing for two years!”

**Helpful tip**
This game can be a great way to practice finding positives in challenging situations. // It can also be tiring if one person is always having to come up with the “fortunately” sentence, responsible for fixing things! // If you’re playing with two people, consider switching each round who starts with Fortunately or Unfortunately so the responsibility stays balanced.`,

One person says, “[Name]… tell me about the time…” and finishes the sentence with a wild, imaginative prompt that is clearly not real. // The other person immediately jumps into telling the story, fully committing to the idea using that “Yes, And” guiding improv principle.

The listener can ask questions along the way to help the story grow.

**Example**
“Tell me about the time you accidentally took a bath in green food coloring.” // The other player launches into the story as if it really happened: “Oh, I had almost forgotten about that! I thought it was essential oils so I squirted the whole bottle in the tub thinking it would smell good!”

**Prompts to get you started**
* Tell me about the time a cow wandered into your backyard and you had to find its owner
* Tell me about the time you were about to bite into an orange and it started screaming
* Tell me about the time you drank so much lemonade you bounced onto the roof
* Tell me about the time your shoes ran away without you`,

  title: "One-Word Song",
  text: `**How to play**
Make up a song by switching off every word. // One person says or sings a word, then the next person adds the next word, continuing back and forth.

You can clap or snap to keep a beat, try to rhyme, or ignore rhyming altogether.

**Example**
“I” // “love” // “beans” // “so” // “much” // “don’t” // “you?”

**Ways to make it easier**
* Switch off every line instead of every word
* Choose a silly song title ahead of time to give yourselves some direction
    * “I Love Beans”
    * “Don’t You Worry ‘Bout That Pimple”
    * “Goody Goody Gumdrops”

**Warm-up option**
If making up a song feels like too much pressure, start by rewriting a song you both know well into a simple parody! // This gives you a structure to build from and is a fun creative challenge.

**Optional challenge**
* Add a steady rhythm or tempo

  title: "Build-a-Rap",
  text: `**How to play**
First: Establish the rhythm // Everyone starts and continues with the same steady beat: // “Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba”

This rhythm happens:
* At the very beginning
* In between every rhyming line
* Anytime the group needs to reset or regroup

Next: // One person starts by setting the rhyme. // They say: // “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with ___,” // and choose a simple one-syllable word that is easy to rhyme with.

Everyone immediately does the rhythm together: // Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba

Then the next person adds a rhyming line. // After each line, everyone returns to the rhythm before the next person goes.

Players take turns adding new rhymes that match the same sound.

**Example flow**
Player one: “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with bee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player two: “Oops, I fell and scraped my knee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player three: “And then I really had to pee.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba // Player four: “But look, I found my missing key.” // Everyone: Bum-ba-dadum-badum-badum-ba

**Reminder**
The goal is simply to keep the rhyme going. // The story does not have to make sense. // Each line just needs to rhyme and fit the rhythm!

**If someone gets stuck**
If it’s your turn and you can’t think of a rhyme, you can always reset the game by saying: // “I’m thinking of a word that rhymes with ___,” // and choosing a new rhyme.

Everyone then switches to rhyming with that new word and keeps going.

**Optional advanced version**
At a higher level, the group can try to shout the final rhyming word together, guessing what the speaker is about to say based on context and the rhyme sound. // This is what gives it that “Beastie Boys” feel.

This is fun but completely optional. // The game is just as fun without that aspect!

**Helpful tips**
* Keep the beat steady and forgiving
* Silly is perfect; it doesn’t need to make sense or even be a real word
* Resetting is part of the game, not a failure`,

Choose a song everyone knows well. // Sing the song together, but trade off every syllable, one at a time, rotating through the players.

* Player two: “are”

**Example starters**
* “Our New Favorite Donut Shop”

**Example**
Player one holds up a bar of soap and sings, “Bar of soap!” // Player two responds, “The cleanest armpits you’ll ever smell!”

**Helpful tip before playing**
It can help to briefly remind kids what jingles are before you start. // Listening to or recalling familiar ones gives everyone a sense of the vibe.

Examples include:
* “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there”
* “Ba da ba ba ba, I’m lovin’ it” (McDonald's)
* “We are farmers… bum buh dum dum bum dum dum” (Farmers Insurance)

There is no required structure, but it often helps to think of a jingle as:
* Singing the product name
* Saying what it does
* Or why it’s great

That framework can make it easier to jump in.

**Ways to play anywhere**
* At home with random household items
* In the car by making jingles for billboards or businesses you pass
* At the store by quietly inventing jingles as you shop together - hand each other random items and challenge each other to come up with a jingle on the spot!`,

The Mystery Guest either leaves the room or covers their ears and looks away while the identity is chosen.

A quick-fire acting game where players jump into a character or object for just ten seconds.

**How to play**
Take turns giving each other a random, weird prompt. // As soon as the prompt is given, count down from ten while the other person acts it out as fully as they can.

When the countdown ends, stop, laugh, and switch roles with a new prompt.

**Example prompts**
* A baby bird hatching out of an egg, confused at first, then spotting its mom
* A rocking chair being built and rocked for the very first time
* A firework show going off in the sky

**How it works**
There is no planning time. // The actor jumps in immediately and commits, even if the idea is unclear. // Big choices and exaggerated movement make it more fun.

**Tips for coming up with prompts**
* Look around the room for inspiration
* Use inanimate objects as characters
* Think of a type of movement and work backward
    * Exploding might become fireworks

A creative movement game where one person gently shapes the other into a pose and then gives it a fun, imaginative title.

**How to play**
One person is the Sculptor. // The other person is the Sculpture.

Before you begin, quickly agree on consent and boundaries so everyone feels comfortable. // The Sculpture stays loose and relaxed while the Sculptor gently guides them into a position using light, respectful movement.

Once the pose is complete, the Sculptor names the sculpture.

Then switch roles.

**Example**
The Sculptor positions the Sculpture sitting down with hands on their head. // The Sculptor says, “I call this sculpture: You’re on a roller coaster and your wig just flew off.”

**How it works**
The Sculptor’s job is to move slowly and clearly. // The Sculpture’s job is to stay relaxed and go along with the shaping.

The pose does not need to make sense at first. // The title brings it to life.

**Optional variations**
* Let the Sculpture come alive for three seconds after being named
* Have the Sculpture guess what the title might be before hearing it
* Take turns sculpting without touching by using only verbal directions

**Helpful tip**

This game works with two or more players.

One person is the Prompt-Giver. // They give a funny, vivid prompt for a pose. // Then they turn off the lights and count down slowly: “3… 2… 1…”

While the lights are off, the other player or players strike a pose that matches the prompt as dramatically as possible.

At the end of the countdown, the Prompt-Giver turns the lights back on to reveal the poses.

Switch roles and play again with a new prompt.

**How it works**
The fun comes from the surprise reveal. // Big, exaggerated poses work best. // There is no talking once the lights go off, just commitment.

**Ways to play with groups**
* Players can work together to create one shared pose
* Or each person can make their own interpretation of the prompt

Working together is especially great for siblings practicing collaboration and shared decision-making.

**Example prompts**
* You just looked up and saw a grandma skydiving straight toward you
* You’re a frog who just fell off your lily pad and feels very embarrassed
* You’re a snowman whose carrot nose just got eaten by the neighbor’s dog
* You just caught a whiff of your own stinky armpit and you’re about to faint

**Optional variations**
* Count down faster or slower
* Use a flashlight instead of a light switch
* If you can’t do lights on or lights off or don’t want to, the person counting can simply close their eyes as they count down! The lights just give it an added layer of fun and mischief`,

  text: `**Premise**
A twist on classic charades where one person directs the action and the other person has to figure out what they’re acting out.

**How to play**
One person is the Director. // The other person is the Actor.

Instead of acting something out themselves, the Director gives specific physical instructions to guide the Actor’s movements. // The Actor follows the instructions exactly without knowing what they are supposed to be.

Once the instructions are complete, the Actor tries to guess what action, profession, animal, or scenario they were just acting out.

Then switch roles and play again.

**Example**
Director: “Squat down.” // “Put your hands on the ground between your legs.” // “Stick your tongue out really fast and then pull it back in.”

Actor guesses: “I’m a frog catching a fly.”

**How it works**
The Director’s job is to be clear and specific with movements, not to hint verbally at the answer. // The Actor’s job is to fully commit to each instruction and then make a guess.

**Helpful tip**
If this feels too tricky or frustrating, regular charades is always a great fallback.

**Optional variations**
* Time the instructions and see how quickly the Actor can guess
* Use animals, jobs, or everyday activities as prompts

A cooperative physical game where two people work together to become one character.

**How to play**
One person stands or kneels and places their arms behind their back. // The other person stands behind them and gently slides their arms under the front person’s armpits, becoming their “arms.”

Before starting, make sure everyone is comfortable with positioning and physical boundaries.

Once set, the pair acts together as one character.

**How it works**
* The person in front is the Voice and Face
* The person in back is the Arms

If the front person is talking or singing, the Arms try to match the words with expressive gestures. // If the Arms make a bold or unexpected gesture, the front person goes along with it and justifies it out loud.

The goal is shared commitment, not control.

**Example ideas**
* Sing a song together with big, dramatic arm movements
* Act out a story or short scene
* Record a silly birthday message for someone
* Use props like hats, scarves, or balloons to add chaos

**Optional variations**
* Switch roles halfway through

This game works best with two people.

One person puts an oversized T-shirt on over their head without putting their arms through the sleeves. // They then put pants on their arms and socks and shoes on their hands.

That person kneels down and places their hands on the ground. // The hands now function as the “legs.”

Once positioned correctly, it looks like one person whose legs are floating in the air.

**Before you start**
Set up your phone to record before getting situated. // Once you’re in position, it’s tricky to reset!

**How it works**
The “legs” can:

* Clap together
* Do silly tricks
* Do ridiculously flexible yoga poses and stretches

The object is never what it actually is. // It becomes whatever the player imagines it to be. // Commitment matters more than cleverness.

**Optional variations**
* Pass the same prop around and let each person reinterpret it differently
* Act without words and let others guess what it is
* Use multiple props at once to build a bigger idea

**Helpful tip**
If you feel stuck, look at the shape, size, or texture of the object and let that guide your imagination.

**Clean-up tip**
Make up a “rule” that you can only pull out one prop at a time and put the first one back before you pull out the next one.

**Why this game matters**
Props encourages flexible thinking, creativity, and confidence. // It teaches kids to see possibilities everywhere and reinforces the improv idea that anything can become something new with imagination.`,

  title: "Shark Tank or Infomercial",
  text: `**Premise**
A creative pitch game where everyday objects are reinvented as something completely new.

**How to play**
Find a random object and assign it a brand-new purpose that is not its real use. // The more unexpected, the better.

Once the object has a new identity, choose one of two ways to play.

**Option 1: Infomercial**
One person acts as the Presenter and dramatically sells the invention.

Include:
* What it is
* What problem it solves
* Why it’s amazing

You can add:
* A slogan
* A jingle
* A limited-time deal

**Example**
A blanket becomes a luxury wig that keeps your head warm in extreme weather. // “Are you tired of cold ears. Try the Cozy Crown today.”

**Option 2: Shark Tank**
One person pitches the invention. // The other player or players act as Investors and ask questions to decide whether they’re “in” or “out.”

Investors might ask:
* How does it work
* Who is it for
* Why hasn’t anyone thought of this before

The pitcher answers confidently and creatively, making everything sound intentional and impressive.

**Example**
A watch becomes a time-travel device that only goes five minutes into the past.

**How it works**
This is about commitment, not realism. // The presenter treats the invention as groundbreaking. // The investors respond seriously, even when the idea is ridiculous.

**Optional variations**
* Switch roles halfway through
* Add a timer for the pitch
* Combine both versions by pitching first, then making a commercial

**Why this game matters**
Shark Tank or Infomercial builds creativity, confidence, and persuasive storytelling. // It encourages kids to expand ideas, respond to questions on the fly, and support imaginative thinking without judgment.`,

  category: "PROPS GAMES",
  title: "20-Second Costume",
  text: `**Premise**
A fast-paced creativity game where players build a costume out of random items in just 20 seconds.

**How to play**
Set a timer for 20 seconds. // When the timer starts, everyone rushes to grab nearby items and throws together a costume on the spot. // Anything goes.

When time is up, freeze.

Take turns either:
* Proudly explaining your costume, or
* Delivering a line fully in character while the others react to you as that character

**Example ideas**
* A throw-blanket toga
* A paper towel roll as a rhino horn
* A coffee mug as a grumpy office worker
* A scarf cape superhero

**How it works**
The costume does not need to be wearable, logical, or secure. // The fun comes from speed, improvisation, and commitment.

**Helpful tip for cleanup**
Reset the timer for 30 seconds afterward.
* First 10 seconds: everyone puts items back where they belong
* Remaining time: reset and get ready for the next round

This keeps the game fun without leaving a mess behind.

**Optional variations**
* Add a theme like superheroes, animals, or jobs
* Have everyone strike a pose instead of speaking
* Interview each character briefly`,

  category: "PROPS GAMES",
  title: "Unboxing Video",
  text: `**Premise**
A pretend influencer game where players dramatically “unbox” ordinary objects as if they are incredible.

**How to play**
One person secretly fills a box with random, everyday items. // They hand the box to the other player, who pretends they are filming an unboxing video.

The unboxer opens the box one item at a time and reacts with over-the-top excitement, describing each object as if it is impressive, luxurious, or groundbreaking.

After a few items, switch roles and play again.

**Example**
The unboxer pulls out a pencil and says, “Look at this. It’s solid wood. This thing is definitely not snapping in half during homework. You can just feel the quality.”

**How it works**
The object itself does not matter. // The enthusiasm does. // Treat every item like it’s the best thing you’ve ever seen.

**Optional variations**
* Add a fake brand name or backstory
* Give each item a rating
* Pretend the audience is asking questions
* Film it and watch it back together`,

{
  number: 78,
  category: "PROPS GAMES",
  title: "Fake Hacks",
  text: `**Premise**
A parody game where players invent ridiculous, unnecessary “life hacks” for everyday tasks.

**How to play**
One person grabs an everyday object and confidently explains a totally fake “hack” for how it’s actually supposed to be used.

The explanation should sound serious and convincing, even though the method is clearly absurd.

After the demonstration, switch players or objects and try a new hack.

**Example**
“Oh, you think you’re supposed to brush your teeth like this, but you’ve actually been brushing them all wrong. You’re supposed to hold the toothbrush completely still and jiggle your head back and forth so the weight of your head does all the work.”

**How it works**
The fun comes from commitment. // The hack should be overly specific, dramatically confident, and completely unnecessary.

**Ways to play**
* Use objects around the house like a TV remote, coffee mug, book, or shoe
* Pretend you’re filming a viral tutorial video
* Add phrases like “most people don’t know this” or “dentists hate this trick”

**Optional variations**
* Have another player react as a shocked viewer
* Rate the hack on how “life-changing” it is
* Chain hacks together into a full fake tutorial`,
